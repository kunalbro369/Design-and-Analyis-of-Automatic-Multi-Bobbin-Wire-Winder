# Design-and-Analyis-of-Automatic-Multi-Bobbin-Wire-Winder

Winding machines are utilized in wire drawing manufacturing line. A solitary bobbin winder that is utilized presently in the business has certain disadvantages connected with production like time utilization for supplanting bobbins and supplanting bobbins. We have fostered a Tripod style horizontal Multi bobbin winder which is worked utilizing different motor regulators or PLC and a basic electronic controlled system to wind the wire around every bobbin at the underlying phase of winding. The Winding, replacing of bobbin, entanglement and clamping of wire on bobbin is done automatically. The motivation behind this improvement was to improve the production rate and accuracy while utilizing less labour and time.
